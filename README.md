# smatch
Augmented reality android application.
It's a small idea based on smart watch(smatch) which came into an application with the help of Unity and Vuforia.

# Description:
The app is an augmented watch which can have different features in it.
Our idea is to include features like clock, phone call notification, 3D-animation, gallery, videoplayer, camera and
 videogames to the smart watch in the augmented domain. 
Due to the time constraint, we could only include some of the features that are mentioned above.The included features are clock,
 phonecall notification and 3D-animation.

# controls
Virtual buttons are designed to control the features.
# PS
Apk and target image are in "APK" folder.
You can install the apk file after downloading and unzipping file.

Any feedbacks/suggestions are welcomed.
