# smatch
-Augmented reality android application.
-Its an small idea based on smart watch(smatch) which came into an application with the help of Unity and Vuforia.

# Description:
-The app is a augmented watch which can have different features in it.
-Our idea is to include features like clock,phone call notification, 3D-animation, gallery, videoplayer, camera and
 videogames to the smart watch in the augmented domain. 
-Due to the time constraint we could only include some of the features that are mentions above, the included features are clock,
 phonecall notification and 3D-animation.

# controls
-Virtual buttons are designed to control the features.
# PS
-Apk and target image are in "APK" folder.
-You can install the apk file after downloading and unzipping file.


-Any feedbacks/suggestions are welcomed.
